        <p>Jack's father died when he was young and his mother left him in the 'care' of her mother, Jack's grandmother, who was (at a minimum) physically abusive towards her grandson. The emotional trauma from these events was strong enough that as an adult, Jack had his grandmother murdered, and no doubt contributed towards his mental decline.</p>
        <p>Later in life Jack married and had a daughter, Angel, one of the universe's rare Sirens. During Angel's childhood, Jack was surprised to learn Angel had the power to control technology, which ultimately made her a target for bandits and other kidnappers; a fate that would ultimately come to pass in a standoff between a kidnapper and Jack. Jack tried to plead for Angel's return to safety from said man who adamantly refused, and was caught off guard when Angel, in a fit of rage, took over a turret and killed both the kidnapper and her mother (by accident), which Jack immediately reacted to with sorrow and blame.</p>
        <p>After killing Harold Tassiter and destroying the Claptrap product line, Jack becomes the president of Hyperion. He then declares himself as the dictator of Pandora, intending to rule over the populace with an iron fist to eliminate "bandits", whilst also gathering Eridium to charge the Vault Key he stole from Patricia Tannis to unlock another Vault containing a powerful creature known as the Warrior, in order to secure his rule over the planet. He also maintains a facade when addressing everyone on Pandora, including his attempt to build the city of Opportunity and using the Hyperion Truth Network to spread propaganda. Jack is killed shortly after the Warrior is destroyed.  </p>
